      <description>I would play with site design every day, from when I got home from work until passing out after 2AM. My workspace was a corner desk with a large 22&amp;quot; flat screen CRT and a Mac mini, with barely enough memory to drive the display. My chair constantly hit the railing of my bed, which barely fit in the room. The screen made it feel like the room was bigger. What I worked on made it feel like anything was good enough.
People used what I made and that was rewarding.</description>

      <description>Coffee Snob No, not really. I&amp;rsquo;ve lived off of vending machine coffee. There are break rooms and rest stops where I know what number pad combination makes me a coffee I&amp;rsquo;ll drink for the next hour. Gas stations can make a decent brew, necessary when driving across the country.
I might come across as a coffee snob because I care a lot about roasts and equipment. OK, I can accept that. However, just because I spend money on coffee doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately make me a snob. I choose to spend more money than most people, which is fine.</description>

      <description>My name is Adam Whitlock (pronouns he/him) and I like to think of myself as being many things.
Professional Work Engineering Management I keep an updated manager README.md on Github if you want to learn how I approach management and my guiding principles.
Site Design &amp;amp; Details The site is hosted on Github, using Github Pages. Website code is statically generated, meaning that all content on this site was pre-generated and not rendered. There&amp;rsquo;s no Javascript in use at the moment, but if some gets added I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully remember to update this section with that info.</description>

      <title>Music Streaming with Volumio and Raspberry Pi</title>
      <link>https://adamwhitlock.com/archive/volumio/</link>

      <description>I wanted a device that could stream audio from a media server like Plex, not be reliant on Bluetooth for connectivity, allow me to use my existing speakers, and provide high quality audio output. I also wanted a solution that didnâ€™t have me vendor-locked, like using Chromecast Audio or Amazon Echo. This left little options, other than buying a very nice wireless DAC or similar device.
About nine months ago it occurred to me that I could build what I wanted, far cheaper than most solutions. It would also prove to be a fun project and stretch some of my knowledge of audiophile equipment.</description>
