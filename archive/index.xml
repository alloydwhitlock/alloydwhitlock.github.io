      <description>I used to play with site design every day, from when I got home from work until I passed out at 2 in the morning. I&amp;rsquo;d feel motivated to make some element splash onto the DOM for the first time, seeing how it worked. Twiddling away at design was fun, but after a while I lost my motivation for it. I know why and I know which browser to blame (Internet Explorer), but hadn&amp;rsquo;t really jumped back into it. I have done some light design work for jobs, but mostly to get tools working.</description>

      <description>I wanted a device that could stream audio from a media server like Plex, not be reliant on Bluetooth for connectivity, allow me to use my existing speakers, and provide high quality audio output. I also wanted a solution that didnâ€™t have me vendor-locked, like using Chromecast Audio or Amazon Echo. This left little options, other than buying a very nice wireless DAC or similar device.
About nine months ago it occurred to me that I could build what I wanted, far cheaper than most solutions. It would also prove to be a fun project and stretch some of my knowledge of audiophile equipment.</description>
